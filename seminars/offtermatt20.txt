Parameterized systems are models for interactions between an arbitrary number of interaction partners. While for each fixed number of participants, the corresponding instance of the system is finite-state, there are infinitely many instances. I will present a method that is capable of proving correctness for all instances of such a system. This method is called view abstraction, and it relies on an abstraction function which extracts patterns, called views, from the states of the system. These patterns are used to compute an overapproximation of the reachable states of the system. The accuracy of the overapproximation is governed by a parameter, and when it becomes accurate enough, the system can be proven safe without examining the whole state space. I will present my implementation of this method, and as a case-study present a prototype implementation of manual tool-assisted generation of population protocols that makes use of this method to give feedback to the user.
