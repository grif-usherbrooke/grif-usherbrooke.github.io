Verification of Flat FIFO Systems

The decidability and complexity of reachability problems and 
model-checking for flat counter systems have been explored in detail. 
However, only few results are known for flat FIFO systems, only in some
particular cases (a single loop or a single bounded expression).

We prove, by establishing reductions between properties, and by reducing 
SAT to a subset of these properties that many verification problems like 
reachability, non-termination, unboundedness are NP-complete for flat 
FIFO systems, generalizing similar existing results for flat counter 
systems.

We construct a trace-flattable counter system that is bisimilar to a 
given flat FIFO system, which allows to model-check the original flat 
FIFO system. Our results lay the theoretical foundations and open the 
way to build a verification tool for (general) FIFO systems based on 
analysis of flat subsystems.
